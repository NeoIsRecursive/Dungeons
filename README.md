## [Try it out here!](http://neoishere.com/legacy/sites/dungeons/dungeons.html)

This is a game made with javascript, it has one level and acts more like a "techdemo" since I
wasn't that good at game design and when the major features was coded I lost interest.

If someone is interested in forking and doing something with it please do!
